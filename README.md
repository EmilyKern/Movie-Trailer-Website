# Movie-Trailer-Website  
### Description
The Movie Trailer Website project consists of server-side code to store a list of movies titles, along with its respective box art imagery and movie trailer website. The data should be served as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers of a few of my favorite movies.  
### Running the Movie Trailer  
To run this project simply do the following:
* Clone it to your local system  
* Open `movieInfo.py` in _IDLE_  
* Run Module  
The site will be displayed in your browser after a static html file is created in the root directory. Also I am running version 3.6.0 of python.  

### Help Notes  
* To help me generate a website that displays these movies, **Udacity** have provided a **Python module called `fresh_tomatoes.py`** - this module has a function called `open_movies_page` that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes a few of my favorite movies.  
* I used [The Movie DB API](https://www.themoviedb.org) to get the movie posters displayed.
